Want to create a Node app based off my scholarly paper work. This well help me understand the core techonlogies in a meaningful way.

Start
------
cd /home/pjlinn/Documents/gitHub/homeTheaterNodeApp/fullHomeTheaterApp
node server/bin/www || nodemon server/bin/www

Steps
---------
1. Automate the creation of schemas and filling the mongoDb schemas with prepopulated information
	a) Create tests that will do this - consult the MongoDB tutorial
	b) Create a simple form to do this as well

2. Use Express(?) to render the data on the screen given different path commands
